# Wreath-Dataset

# The dataset is contained within a zip file named 'train' with 5 classes. For YOLO versions, it is divided into two folders for images and labels. 
# The images folder contains subfolders for both training and validation, as does the labels folder. Regarding ResNet50 and YOLO versions with two classes, 
# they are located within the 'train2' zip file, structured similarly to the 'train' zip file with 5 classes, including separate folders for images and labels.
